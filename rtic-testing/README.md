Rust cortex-m-rtic on Adafruit nRF52 Pro (nRF52832)
===================================================

This repository contains test code that uses the cortex-m-rtic framework to create real-time embedded firmware in the Rust language.

It runs on an nRF52832 SoC found on the Adafruit nRF52 Pro Feather. Code is uploaded using a Segger JLink EDU Mini.

To build, load, and debug the code, run `cargo embed nrf`
